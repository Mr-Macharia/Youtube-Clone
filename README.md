## **Project Overview**

This project is a simplified clone of the YouTube platform, built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the basic layout and structure of the YouTube homepage, featuring sections such as navigation, video thumbnails, sidebar menus, and a search bar. This clone does not include any JavaScript or backend functionality—it's a static front-end representation that mimics the visual design of YouTube.

   - A **grid of video thumbnails** resembling the YouTube home page feed. Each video thumbnail includes:
     - A video preview image.
     - Video title and channel name.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-friendly experience.
